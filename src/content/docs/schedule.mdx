All class meetings have a beginning of class quiz that starts promptly at 3 PM
unless otherwise indicated.

All assignment turnins are through the course gradescope page. Readings marked
with 🧑‍🎓 are only required for graduate students; readings marked with 📵 will
not be covered on the quiz.

All content videos I record for this class will be in this list, but also will
be added to the [CS 484 YouTube
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLdcXU8teKI&list=PLhy9gU5W1fvVzUp2rumzEFwG71mEPLrBt).
