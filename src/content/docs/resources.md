I will be keeping my lecture notes and descriptions of what I personally think
are the most important concepts within the "readings" section of the web page.
However, these are helpful resources - some are textbook-like, some are more
focused, and some are just interesting. I recommend that you take a look if you're feeling curious or need to review a given topic, and browse around until you find a resource that works for you.
