## {frontmatter.description}

**Due**: {formatTime(localizeTime(frontmatter.due))}

This is the first checkpoint for your final project. The most important things you must do before turning it in are:

* Find a group to work with
* Come up with a basic project idea
* Create a GitHub repository for your project and share it with your team and the course staff

## Project requireemnts

The requirements for the project idea are:

### It must not be a CRUD app

CRUD stands for create, retrieve, update, delete (common database operations). A
CRUD app is typically an application that builds a user interface around those
database operations (and not much else). As I mentioned in class - CRUD apps
make the world go round, there are literally millions of them.


## What makes a good project?




### Deliverables

The two deliverables are your repository (it can be empty, but you can also get
started on it if you want), and submitting [This form]({frontmatter.form_url}).
Remember that this assignment is not worth any points

### What happens if you don't turn in the checkpoint?

Nothing besides the MVP (due in week 12) and the final project (due at the end
of week 15) are graded for points. The things that you propose in each
checkpoint set expectations for what your group will do and how you'll do it. If
you don't set those expectations, I'll just grade everything based on what I
think a good project is expected to do - you could receive full points because
what you did was actually fine, or you could receive zero points because you're
implementing a CRUD app or what you chose isn't substantial enough or what you
chose is a carbon copy of something else that exists out in the world.
