## {frontmatter.description}

By {formatTime(localizeTime(frontmatter.due))}, you must:

- Turn in a snapshot of your repository that includes a link to your deployed app in `README.md` this can be your main app URL, or a branch deploy.
- Include a description of what your app currently does
- Ensure that a brand new user of the app can sign up, log in, and use those features
  - If you need to manually grant developer permissions (i.e. for using an API, I know Google and Spotify both require this), please reach out to us before turn-in and ask us which username we will be signing up with.
- Optional but helpful - include a screencast that shows your current functionality in action. I should be able to run the app myself when I visit it though.

The entire final project is worth 15% of your grade. This deliverable is worth 5% - the final deliverable will be worth 10%.
