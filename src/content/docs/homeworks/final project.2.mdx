## {frontmatter.description}

## This document is a PLACEHOLDER. The deliverable details and deadline will be finalized by the previous checkpoint deadline.

By {formatTime(localizeTime(frontmatter.due))}, your repository must:

- Include a description of what your app currently does
- Include a link to the deployment of your app in `README.md` - this can be your main app URL, or a branch deploy.
- Optional but helpful - include a screencast that shows your current functionality in action. I should be able to run the app myself when I visit it though.

The entire final project is worth 15% of your grade. This deliverable is worth 5% - the final presentation will be worth 10%.
