# Homework1 - Crud App

## Checking your work

### Running testcases locally

## Deploying your Application.

There are no points awarded for deploying your app to a live server, but it is a
good exercise to get familiar with the process. Hono can be deployed to Render
as a Node.js app - that is basically exactly what you've created here and the
most straightforward way to do so. However if you'd like some experience
deploying to a serverless provider, you can reconfigure [Hono to work on a
serverless app platform](https://hono.dev/docs/concepts/web-standard) and
[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/learn/tutorials) to use a serverless
database provider.

## Submitting your work

After you are confident that your code works, you can push the code to GitHub,
and then submit it via Gradescope. You can find the link to our class gradescope
in the sidebar. If you have issues with the autograder, please
contact us via Piazza ASAP. **Please keep in mind that technical issues while
submitting your assignment is not an acceptable excuse for improper or late
submissions.**
