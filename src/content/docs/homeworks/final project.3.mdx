**Due**: {formatTime(localizeTime(frontmatter.due))}

## This document is a PLACEHOLDER. The deliverable details and deadline will be finalized by the previous checkpoint deadline.

The final project will be graded similarly to the first checkpoint. I will be grading the final projects based on one the below things:

1. The "what does your application do" functionality described in Checkpoint 0.
2. Any changes to the above that we have agreed upon since then.

As with the MVP checkpoint, after the deadline I will use your app to determine
whether it has the functionality you've described. I will start grading it ASAP,
so please don't take time away from your other classes to continue working on it -
in fact, unless you have very good CI/CD set up, it would be very risky to
continue deploying new versions that you haven't tested, because you don't know
when I will decide to grade it.

Like the MVP, you can submit a screencast with your assignment to show me how to
use your app if I need to know how to do so. I won't grade that (I will only
grade the app as it runs for me), but I will refer to it if I need to.

Importantly, I will only attempt to grade your assignment once, and you'll get
the grade you get. The only reason I would re-grade it is if there was some
outage beyond your control (which I can verify using any of the various status
pages for the services you're using, like the [netlify status
page](https://www.netlifystatus.com/) [vercel status
page](https://www.vercel-status.com/) [supabase status
page](https://status.supabase.com/) etc.
