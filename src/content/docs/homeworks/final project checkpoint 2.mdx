## {frontmatter.description}

**Due**: {formatTime(localizeTime(frontmatter.due))}

TLDR: submit [this form](https://forms.gle/9vWfqfpUCJ4p9bBK7) before the deadline.


### What to submit

For this deliverable you must describe, as precisely as possible, the specific architecture that your app will use. If you'll be using any particular framework, library, database, software as a service, etc, identify it and show where it fits into your overall architecture.

I would gently suggest using excalidraw and providing a link to that diagram, but you don't need to if you feel you can adequately describe your architecture without it.


### What happens if you don't turn in the checkpoint?

Nothing besides the MVP (due in week 12) and the final project (due at the end
of week 15) are graded for points. The things that you propose in each
checkpoint set expectations for what your group will do and how you'll do it. If
you don't set those expectations, I'll just grade everything based on what I
think a good project is expected to do - you could receive full points because
what you did was actually fine, or you could receive zero points because you're
not implementing what I expected you'd implement. It's highly recommended you do
the work to prepare and submit this checkpoint.
