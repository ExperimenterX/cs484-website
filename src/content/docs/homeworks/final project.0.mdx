**Due**: {formatTime(localizeTime(frontmatter.due))}

As mentioned on Piazza, your final project pitch is due at the start of class on
Wednesday of next week. Please submit your pitch on Gradescope using the shell
available in <a href={frontmatter.github_url}>this repository</a>.

Important things to remember:

- You don't actually get any points for submitting this, but it's a deadline to
  help you stay on track with coming up with a project idea and project team.
- Submit your Gradescope assignment with your team for the final project. The
  system should allow you to choose your own teammates for the group submission.
- Make sure you include the repository URL in the README.md. The way that
  Gradescope works, we don't actually see what repository you are uploading
  from.
- Please make `sauravjoshi` and `kaytwo` collaborators on your repository if
  it's private and you want our help. Also remember to push your code if you ask
  a question about how to get something to work.
- Making your repository public is totally fine, asking others in class for help
  is totally fine. You won't be penalized either way. All code must be your own.
  GenAI assistance is OK, but let us know which one(s) you used and how you used
  them.
