# What you should know coming into this course

At UIC, this course has one prerequisite: CS 341, Programming Language Design and Implementation, which doesn't teach web or security topics, but does give students practice with picking up new programming languages quickly. JavaScript incorporates rather esoteric concepts like closures, functional programming, and quite a bit of event driven programming, and having seen these paradigms previously will be of great help. Learning new languages and new programming paradigms are common tasks in the life of a software engineer; learning how to apply your underlying ability to decompose and systematize a task using a new language will implicitly be part of your learning experience in this class.
