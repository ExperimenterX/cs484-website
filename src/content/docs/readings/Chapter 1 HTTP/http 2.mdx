By the late 1990's, it was clear that the web was the most widespread end user
protocol for client-server applications. However, lots of decisions made when
the web was being used by mere thousands of people were discovered to not be
that great when exposed to hundreds of millions. Enter HTTP/2.

## The problems with HTTP/1.1

* Head of line blocking
* Incentive to bundle resources and use multiple connections
* Inefficient use of space in headers, which is especially bad at the beginning of a TCP connection

## The solutions in HTTP/2

### Multiplexing: Solving Head-of-Line Blocking
One of the key innovations of HTTP/2 is **multiplexing**. This allows multiple
HTTP requests and responses to be sent over a single TCP connection at the same
time. Unlike HTTP/1.x, which had to wait for each request to finish before
starting a new one (or open multiple connections to work around this), HTTP/2
allows streams of data to flow in parallel without interference. This allows
both multiple requests and responses to be interleaved, as well as individual
pieces of those individual requests and responses to be sent whenever they're
ready. This allows HTTP/2 to do everything it can to **keep the pipe full** - in
other words, if there is data avaialble to send, it will be sent. 

Multiplexing also reduces the incentive to open multiple connections to the same server


or bundle individual resources together, as HTTP/2 can handle multiple requests
efficiently over a single connection.

### Header Compression: Reducing Overhead
Another issue in HTTP/1.x was the overhead caused by large HTTP headers, which
could be sent repeatedly with each request. HTTP/2 introduced **HPACK**, a
header compression mechanism that minimizes the amount of redundant information
transmitted. This is especially important for requests to the same server, where
headers often remain largely unchanged between requests.

By compressing and reusing headers, HTTP/2 reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up
transmission, especially on resource-heavy pages with many repeated requests.


Both multiplexing and header compression disincentivize "hacks" like domain
sharding and image sprites, which were mainly used to engineer around the
limitations of HTTP/1.1. H/2 removes the performance penalty of sending lots of
very small HTTP requests and responses (with repeated headers), or of making
multiple connections that all have to use the TCP slow start algorithm to get up
to speed.

### Security: HTTP/2 and TLS
While HTTP/2 can theoretically run without encryption, in practice, all popular
browsers require that always be used with **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**, in
other words, as part of an HTTPS connection.

This focus on "secure by default" is one of many advances in the design of many
modern protocols, which make known-insecure ways of communicating either
impossible or very difficult, and definitely not the out-of-the-box default.
