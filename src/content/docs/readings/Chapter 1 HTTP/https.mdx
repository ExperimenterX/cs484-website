HTTPS fundamentally provides the glue between the HTTP protocol and the TLS
protocol.

Key concepts:

* TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol that provides
  confidentiality and integrity in communication between two parties.
* TLS is a wrapper around HTTP - HTTPS is just HTTP communication wrapped in
  TLS, with verification of the server's identity (the `Host:` header and the
  domain name seen in the URL bar).
* The web uses the Certificate Authority model to establish a foundation of
  trust for HTTPS.

## Cryptography basics

TLS makes use of both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Here's a brief
overview of these concepts:

* **Symmetric Cryptography**: In symmetric cryptography, the same key is used
  for both encryption and decryption. This key must be kept secret between the
  parties involved in the communication.

* **Asymmetric Cryptography**: In asymmetric cryptography, two keys are used: a
  public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption and
  digital signature verification, while the private key is used for decryption
  and digital signature creation. The public key can be shared with anyone,
  while the private key must be kept secret.
  1. To send an encrypted message, the sender encrypts the message with the
     recipient's public key. This message can only be decrypted by the
      recipient's private key, and thus if they keep their private key secret,
      they're the only person who can read the message.
  2. To sign a message, the sender encrypts a hash of the message with their
     private key. The recipient can then decrypt the hash with the sender's
     public key, and if the hash matches the message, they can be sure that the
     message was sent by the person who owns the private key.

* **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange algorithm
  that allows two parties to securely exchange a shared secret key over an
  insecure channel. This shared secret key can then be used for symmetric
  encryption. This algorithm is secure even if an attacker can eavesdrop on the
  communication between the two parties!

## TLS Overview

For the purposes of this class, we need to understand the basics of how TLS
works. Here's a high-level overview:

- **Handshake**: The client and server negotiate a secure connection by
   exchanging messages to agree on cryptographic parameters and establish a
   shared secret key.

  1. The client sends a `ClientHello` message to the server, indicating the
     cryptographic algorithms it supports.
  2. The server responds with a `ServerHello` message, selecting the
      cryptographic algorithm it will use and sending its certificate. This
      certificate contains the information needed for the client to verify,
      using their trusted root store, that the server is who they say they are.
  3. Using the serverâ€™s public key, the client securely generates and sends a
     shared session key (used for symmetric encryption) through a secure key
     exchange algorithm (typically via Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve
     Diffie-Hellman).


<Aside>
TLS is not a "my way or the highway" protocol - it was engineered to allow
  whoever uses it to choose which cryptographic algorithms to use. While this is
  _good_ from a security standpoint: if a cryptographic algortihm is discovered
  to have a weakness, you can switch to a different one. However, this is also a
  weakness in and of itself: "degredation" attacks can be used to force a
  connection to use a weaker cryptographic algorithm. This is but one of many
  engineering tradeoffs that must be made when designing a secure system.
</Aside>

After a successful TLS handshake, the client can be sure that:
* The server is using a public key that has been signed by a trusted Certificate
  Authority.
* All messages they send and receive will be encrypted and secure from
  eavesdroppers.
* An attacker cannot impersonate the communication between the client and
  server.

After a successful handshake, the server can be sure that:
* All messages they send and receive will be encrypted and secure from
  eavesdroppers.
* An attacker cannot impersonate the communication between the client and
  server.

Note that TLS as used on the web does not verify the client's identity. That's
why we still need to use passwords and other authentication mechanisms. The
protocol does allow for client authentication, but it's not commonly used on the
web.

Once a TLS session has been established, the client and server can send and
receive a full duplex reliable in order bytestream. You may recall that this
is exactly what normal HTTP is built on top of. This is why HTTPS is just HTTP
wrapped in TLS - the TLS layer provides the security guarantees, and the HTTP
layer provides the semantics for the communication.

There is one important interaction between the HTTP layer and the TLS layer: the
`Host:` header. The value in this header must match the domain name (or one of
the domain names, because certificates can include multiple or even wildcard
domain names) in the certificate that the server sends. This is how the client
can be sure that they're talking to the server they think they are.

We'll see a lot more details of how HTTPS interacts with other parts of the web
ecosystem - it has implications for which cookies are sent, which protocols can
be used, and even how fast your website loads. But for now, this should provide
you with a mental model for understanding what HTTPS is and how it works.
