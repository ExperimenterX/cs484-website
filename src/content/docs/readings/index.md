Welcome to the readings for CS 484: Secure Web Application Development. Everything in this `/readings/` directory is required reading for the course. I started writing these readings because I wanted a better version of the random blog posts that I was using to introduce modern web application development concepts. The creation of these readings as an open source, publicly available "textbook" has been supported by the Office of the Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and the University Library's 2024-25 Open Textbook Faculty Incentive Program.

If you would like to suggest improvements to the readings (or the course website in general), click the "edit this page" link at the bottom of any page. You'll need to fork the repository first, but after you've made your edits you can request they be merged back in.
