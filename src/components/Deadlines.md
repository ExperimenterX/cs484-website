Our deadlines in this class are **firm**, down to the millisecond. If there are
any documented outages with Gradescope or GitHub during the 12 hours before the
deadline, we'll extend it by 24 hours. For any other exceptional situations, we
drop the lowest homework assignment for every student to be fair to everyone
whether they ask for an exception or not.

Note that extensions due to DRC LOA's do not count toward this policy, please
see the [syllabus](/syllabus/#disability-accommodation-procedures) for more details.

**Please keep in mind that technical issues
while submitting your assignment is not an acceptable excuse for improper or
late submissions.**
